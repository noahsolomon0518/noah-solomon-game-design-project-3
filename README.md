This is a tower defence game. To play, run game.py from the noah_solomon_project_2 directory. 3 levels can be
played, the third being the longest and having all 6 different enemy types. Currently the balancing of levels, enemies and towers is not so great so the levels will be easy. 

Known issues
    1. Balancing
    2. Speed decreases when there are a lot of enemies and towers
    3. Occassionally game crashes with some type of collision error: "ValueError: Error trying to get the hit box   of a sprite, when no hit box is set.Please make sure the Sprite.texture is set to a texture before trying to draw or do collision testing.Alternatively, manually call Sprite.set_hit_box with points for your hitbox.

This is a tower defence game. To play, run game.py from the noah_solomon_project_2 directory. 3 levels can be
played, the third being the longest and having all 6 different enemy types. Currently the balancing of levels, enemies and towers is not so great so the levels will be easy. 

Known issues
    1. Balancing
    2. Speed decreases when there are a lot of enemies and towers

Possible improvements
    1. Speed optimization
    2. Better balancing
    3. Display stats for towers and enemies
    4. Upgrades

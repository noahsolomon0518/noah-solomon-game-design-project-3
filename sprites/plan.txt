Towers

    tower.py module includes a abstract tower class and full implementation of towers. Classes have adjustable
    instance variables of:
        range - Range that tower detects enemies
        cost - how much tower cost
        upgrade_stage - The level of the upgrade of tower
        game - game variable to access enemy sprite list

    Also tower abstract class has functions
        detect() - Finds enemies within range
        fire(target) - Abstract function for attacking enemy
        upgrade() - Upgrades tower to next level if possible



    There will be 2 main types of towers 
        Turret
            Shoot bullets
            Abstract class has variables of:
                speed - interval of shots
                bullet - Bullet it will shoot
                bullet_damage - damage of bullet
                bullet_speed - speed of bullet
                bullet_accuracy - accuracy of shots
        Blaster
            Continuously spray
            Instance variables of:
                damage - damage per second
                spray - sprite used for spray. !!!Need to figure this stuff out

    SimpleTurret
        Standard basic tower that slowly shoots bullets. 
        dps = 25
        cost = 100

    RapidFireTurret
        Shoots very quickly but chaotically
        dps = 50
        cost = 150

    PierceTurret
        Shoots piercing shots
        Additional instance variable:
            bullet_pierce - How many bullet pierces before breaking
        


    MissleTurret
        Shoots bombs. Splash damage
        dps = ?
        cost = 500


    BlizzardBlaster
        Slows down enemies

        cost = 200    
        slow_length - how long getting sprayed slows down enemy

    LightningBlaster
        Continuously shocks enemies
        dps = 125
        cost = 300


Bullet

    bullet.py module provides all implementation of bullets
    Bullet abstract class has following variables
        game - to access sprite list
        speed - how fast bullet travels
        damage - damge of bullet
        accuracy - number from 0 - 1 that describes accuracy
        target - Enemy that bullet initialy aimed for

    Has functions
        move_to_target() - Moves in target direction at speed of <speed> and accuracy of <accuracy>
        on_target_collision() - Abstract class to handle target collision
